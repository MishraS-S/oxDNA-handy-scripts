# oxDNA-handy-scripts


Quick scripts to help with oxDNA simulations/analysis made initially for personal use

json-tacoxdna.py : Converts DNA origami design in cadnano json format and input DNA sequence, to a caca.sqs matrix template that can then be used by tacoxdna's 'cadnano_oxDNA.py' to generate an oxDNA input simulation file. PeiskerT : Added functionality to automatically detect the scaffold start site for linear scaffolds and handle circular scaffolds as well.
